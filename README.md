### Description
This is a modified version of the Eight-Five-Zero template for Zim, which itself is a modified version of the Zero-Five-Eight template.

Like the original Eight-Five-Zero template it helps you to export your Zim notebook as a responsive website that can be viewed in all devices. Differences are:

* At larger screens I moved the navigate side menu back to the left
* At smaller screens the natigate menu moves to the top rather than the bottom
* I added the option to collapse the navigate menu, to save real estate and to reduce page scrolling
